# List of configuration options for this sampler
params:
    step_size: "(float; default=0.01) The size, as a fraction of the total parameter range, of steps to use in the derivative calculation. You should investigate stability wrt this."
    use_numdifftools: "(bool; default=False) Use the library numdifftools instead of the default code (should be little difference)"
# Not currently working:
#    tolerance: "(float; default=0.01) tolerance of the iterative process to find the right step size"
#    maxiter: "(integer; default=10) Max number of iterations to use"
